Azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN) is an organic compound with the chemical formula [(CH3)2C(CN)]2N2. It is a white crystalline powder, insoluble in water but soluble in alcohols and organic solvents. AIBN is widely utilized as a foaming agent in the plastics and rubber industry and as a radical initiator in polymerization processes. Due to its thermal decomposition property, which releases nitrogen gas, AIBN plays a crucial role in chemical synthesis and manufacturing applications.
