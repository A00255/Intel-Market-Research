Stone gypsum is a naturally occurring mineral, primarily composed of calcium sulfate dihydrate (CaSO4·2H2O). It forms as an evaporite from the dissolution of limestone due to exposure to sulfuric acid, commonly associated with volcanic activity. The material is widely utilized across various industries, including construction, medical, and industrial applications, due to its versatile properties such as fire resistance, durability, and ease of molding.
