A steel cable tray system is an engineered structure used to support and route insulated electrical cables used for power distribution, control, and communication. These systems offer a robust alternative to conduit systems, especially in industrial, commercial, and utility settings where cable density and ease of maintenance are critical. Steel cable trays come in various designs, including ladder-type, perforated, and solid-bottom trays. The primary types include stainless steel, galvanized steel, and coated steel, each tailored to specific environments. For instance, stainless steel offers superior corrosion resistance, while galvanized and coated steel trays balance performance and cost. Their structural strength, high load-bearing capacity, and compliance with stringent safety standards make them the preferred choice in sectors such as energy, telecommunications, manufacturing, oil and gas, and infrastructure.
