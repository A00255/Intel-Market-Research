Strobilurin fungicides are a class of agricultural chemicals derived from the naturally occurring antibiotic strobilurin A. These fungicides are highly effective in controlling a broad spectrum of fungal diseases, including water molds, downy mildews, powdery mildews, leaf spots, and rusts. The primary active ingredients in this group include azoxystrobin, kresoxim-methyl, trifloxystrobin, picoxystrobin, and pyraclostrobin. These compounds are widely used across various agricultural applications, such as cereals, field crops, fruits, tree nuts, vegetables, turfgrasses, and ornamentals. Additionally, some strobilurins have been found to promote plant growth in specific conditions.
