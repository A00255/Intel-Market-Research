A mass flow controller (MFC) is a precision device used to measure and control the flow rate of gases in various semiconductor fabrication processes. These devices employ technologies such as thermal mass flow, differential pressure, or Coriolis flow measurement to ensure accuracy and reliability. MFCs are critical components in semiconductor manufacturing as they regulate the precise flow of gases in processes like chemical vapor deposition (CVD), etching, and plasma-enhanced applications. Typically integrated into gas delivery systems, they are operable through digital or analog signals, enabling high precision in maintaining process integrity.
