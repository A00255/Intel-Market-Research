Settlement sensors are specialized instruments designed for monitoring ground movement and structural displacement in civil engineering projects. These sensors play a crucial role in ensuring safety and stability in large-scale infrastructure projects such as tunnels, dams, embankments, and high-rise buildings. The primary function of settlement sensors is to measure shifts in ground levels due to external forces like excavation, grouting, or natural geological movements. With the ability to measure changes up to ±30 degrees, settlement sensors are indispensable in construction and geotechnical engineering, providing real-time monitoring and early warnings to prevent failures and instability.
