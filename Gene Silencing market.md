Gene silencing refers to the regulation of gene expression in a cell to prevent the expression of a specific gene. This process can occur during transcription, post-transcription, or meiosis, and is utilized in research and therapeutic applications. Techniques such as RNA interference (RNAi), antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs), and CRISPR-based systems are employed to silence genes, offering potential treatments for various diseases, including cancer, neurological disorders, and genetic conditions.

Competitor Analysis (in brief)

Recent Developmnet

In February 2025, Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, Inc. commemorated Rare Disease Day by expanding its ‘We’ll Get There Soon’ campaign, which was originally launched for healthcare providers in November 2024. This phase includes the introduction of a dedicated educational website, www.LowerMyTGs.com, along with the Spotlight on FCS white paper. These resources provide essential support for patients with Familial Chylomicronemia Syndrome (FCS), an ultra-rare inherited disorder that seriously impairs the body's ability to metabolize triglycerides. This leads to perilously high triglyceride (TG) levels—usually over 880 mg/dL—and strongly raises the risk of life-threatening illness, including acute pancreatitis. Due to this risk, professional guidelines suggest maintaining triglyceride levels below 500 mg/dL.

In May 2023, Novartis purchased a gene therapy candidate from Avrobio, which was facing financial challenges. Novartis made a superb upfront payment of $87.5 million for the clinical-stage asset with no conditions attached for later payments. The deal came with AVR-RD-04, a hematopoietic stem cell gene therapy program under investigation for the treatment of the rare genetic disorder cystinosis.
