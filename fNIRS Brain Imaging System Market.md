Functional Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (fNIRS) is a cutting-edge technology that allows real-time monitoring of brain activity by measuring blood oxygenation levels in the cerebral cortex. Its advantages—portability, affordability, safety, and ease of use—are accelerating adoption globally.

Key Market Insights

What is fNIRS?
-
fNIRS is a non-invasive optical imaging technique that detects fluctuations in oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin concentrations. It offers crucial insights into brain function during cognitive tasks or therapeutic interventions.

How it Works
-

•	Uses near-infrared light to penetrate the scalp and skull.

•	Measures differential absorption of light by oxyhemoglobin (HbO) and deoxyhemoglobin (HbR).

•	Enables real-time monitoring of brain activity in natural environments.

Market Drivers
=

•	Rising neurological disorders: Increased prevalence of Alzheimer’s, autism, and stroke fuels clinical applications.

•	Growing interest in cognitive neuroscience and behavioral research.

•	Integration with Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) and wearable health technologies.

•	Portability and affordability over MRI and PET systems.


Market Challenges
=
•	Limited depth penetration—cannot image deep brain structures.



•	Lower spatial resolution compared to fMRI.

•	Signal interference due to hair, skin tone, or motion artifacts.
