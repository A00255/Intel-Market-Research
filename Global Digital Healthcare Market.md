Digital Healthcare refers to the integration of digital technologies into every aspect of healthcare services, including prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring. It encompasses a broad range of technological tools and services such as electronic health records (EHRs), telemedicine, mobile health (mHealth) applications, wearable devices, health analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain. These technologies aim to improve the efficiency, accessibility, and quality of healthcare while reducing operational costs and enhancing patient experiences.

At its core, digital healthcare is about enabling smarter healthcare systems that can better serve populations, personalize treatment plans, streamline clinical workflows, and provide real-time data for better decision-making. For instance, telehealth services allow patients in remote areas to consult with specialists without the need to travel. Similarly, AI algorithms can analyze vast datasets to predict disease outbreaks or suggest optimal treatment options for individual patients.

As technology continues to evolve, digital healthcare is becoming a cornerstone in modern medical practice, revolutionizing how care is delivered and managed.

This robust growth trajectory is driven by several factors, including the growing demand for remote healthcare services, increasing adoption of smartphones and wearable devices, advancements in big data analytics, and the pressing need to reduce healthcare costs. Moreover, the COVID-19 pandemic acted as a catalyst for digital transformation, accelerating the integration of telehealth and other digital solutions.

In 2020, the pandemic triggered a 38x increase in telehealth utilization compared to the pre-pandemic baseline, according to McKinsey & Company. Since then, many healthcare systems worldwide have incorporated digital tools into their standard practices, contributing significantly to the market's expansion.

Investments in digital health startups have also surged. In 2023 alone, global funding in the sector exceeded US$ 30 billion, showcasing the growing investor confidence in the market's potential.
