The Allergy Rapid Test refers to a diagnostic tool used for the swift detection of allergic reactions caused by various allergens such as food, plants, dust, hair, and more. These tests provide quick, point-of-care results and are commonly used in hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies. They are essential for identifying allergen sensitivity and supporting timely treatment plans.

Allergies have become a growing health concern globally, driven by environmental factors, dietary changes, and urbanization. This has fueled the demand for rapid, accurate diagnostic tools—placing allergy rapid tests in a pivotal role within the healthcare ecosystem. According to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America, more than 100 million people in the U.S experience some type of allergy each year. Some of the common examples include eczema, seasonal allergy, and food allergies. Further, 1 in 3 U.S adults and 1 in 4 U.S children have any form of seasonal allergy.

According to a 2021 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), a division of the centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 5.8% of children aged 0–17 are diagnosed with a food allergy.
