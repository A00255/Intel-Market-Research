Nickel Sulphate, chemically represented as NiSOâ·6HâO, is a highly soluble, bluish crystalline inorganic compound widely utilized across several industrial applications. It plays a pivotal role in electroplating, chemical manufacturing, and most significantly, the battery sector, especially in lithium-ion battery cathodes for electric vehicles (EVs). With its ability to offer high-purity nickel essential for battery-grade materials, Nickel Sulphate is rapidly becoming a cornerstone in the global shift toward sustainable energy and e-mobility solutions.

In 2023, the global production volume of Nickel Sulphate hit 1.85 million metric tons, with the EV battery segment accounting for 65% of market value. This surge aligns with the booming demand for clean mobility and energy storage solutions.

Competitor Analysis (in brief)
=
The global Nickel Sulphate market is moderately consolidated with major players focusing on strategic expansions, technological improvements, and downstream integration. Notable players include:

•	Umicore – A major supplier of battery materials, emphasizing sustainable sourcing.

•	Norilsk Nickel – Leading in nickel extraction and refining, now expanding into sulphate production.

•	Sumitomo Metal Mining – Invests heavily in battery-grade nickel sulphate.

•	Green Eco-Manufacturer – Known for environmentally responsible nickel sulphate production.

•	Jilin Jien Nickel Industry and Huaze Cobalt & Nickel – Key suppliers in the Chinese domestic market.

Other players like Univertical, Nicomet, Coremax, and Zenith maintain regional strongholds and contribute to niche market development.

January 2024, Sumitomo Metal Mining Canada Ltd., subsidiary of Sumitomo Metal Mining Co., Ltd., purchased 9.9% of the equity of FPX Nickel Corp. through private placement for an amount of about USD 14.45 million. The purpose of this investment is to attain a stable source of nickel supply for battery manufacture.

2024, Abaxx Exchange, headquartered in Singapore, intends to launch the globe's first futures contract for nickel sulphate, a critical ingredient in electric vehicle batteries. The move will offer a new risk management instrument for the market players.

April 2023,  Stellantis and Alliance Nickel Ltd. (formerly GME Resources) have reached agreement to provide 170,000 tons of nickel sulphate and 12,000 tons of cobalt sulphate in five years' supply, representing approximately 40% of the estimated annual output of the NiWest Nickel-Cobalt Project in Western Australia.
