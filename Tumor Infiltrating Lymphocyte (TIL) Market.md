Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocytes (TILs) are a specialized subset of immune cells that penetrate tumor tissues, comprising primarily T-cells but also including B-cells and natural killer (NK) cells. These immune cells recognize and attack cancer cells from within the tumor microenvironment. TIL therapy is a form of adoptive cell transfer that involves isolating TILs from a patient's tumor, expanding them ex vivo, and reinfusing them into the patient to enhance immune response against the tumor. This therapeutic approach is particularly promising in treating solid tumors, such as melanoma, cervical cancer, and head and neck cancers. The global Tumor Infiltrating Lymphocyte (TIL) market encompasses the development, commercialization, and application of TIL-based therapies for cancer treatment.
