Flexible Printed Circuits (FPC), also referred to as flexible circuits, flex circuits, or flexible PCBs, are an essential component in modern electronic designs. FPCs are intricate wiring materials crafted on ultrathin insulation films that enable the formation of compact, bendable, and highly durable electrical circuits. They provide a lightweight alternative to traditional wiring solutions, offering excellent heat resistance and mechanical flexibility. These attributes make FPCs ideal for integration into compact digital devices, where space-saving and enhanced functionality are critical.

Primarily, FPCs are used in consumer electronics such as smartphones, computers, digital cameras, and LCD displays. Their design versatility also extends their application into aerospace, automotive, medical devices, and industrial automation, enabling innovations like foldable displays and wearable electronics. As digital technology advances, the demand for higher functionality within smaller form factors continues to drive the adoption of FPCs globally.
