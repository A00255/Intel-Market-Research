Gypsum Fibreboard is a construction material made from a combination of gypsum and cellulose fibers, typically sourced from recycled paper. Unlike traditional gypsum boards, fibreboards offer enhanced durability, superior moisture resistance, and higher strength, making them suitable for various applications in residential, commercial, and industrial construction. This material is widely used for wall partitions, ceilings, and flooring due to its fire-resistant properties and sustainable composition.
