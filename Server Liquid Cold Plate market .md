A Server Liquid Cold Plate is a type of heat sink that utilizes liquid coolant to dissipate heat from high-power electronic components, such as CPUs and GPUs. It typically consists of a plate with a network of micro-channels or micro-fins for efficient heat transfer, and is connected to a liquid cooling system that circulates coolant through the channels to remove heat from the device. Liquid Cold Plates are commonly used in servers, data centers, and high-performance computing applications where reliable and effective cooling is critical to maintaining system performance.
