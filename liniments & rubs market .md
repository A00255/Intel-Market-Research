Liniments and rubs are topical medications, typically in the form of liquid or semi-liquid preparations, used to relieve pain, inflammation, and muscle stiffness. These formulations are applied externally and are absorbed through the skin, providing therapeutic effects such as analgesia, anti-inflammatory action, and improved circulation. Commonly utilized to treat arthritis, back pain, muscular strains, and sports injuries, liniments and rubs have long held a vital place in over-the-counter (OTC) medication categories across the globe.

The key differentiation among liniments and rubs lies in their formulation: liniments usually have a thinner, more liquid consistency, while rubs are thicker and often emollient-based. Many products in this category include natural or herbal ingredients such as menthol, camphor, eucalyptus oil, or capsaicin, which are favored for their soothing effects and minimal side effects. As consumers increasingly prefer self-care and natural therapies, demand for liniments and rubs is growing steadily.
