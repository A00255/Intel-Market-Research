Chromatic confocal sensors work by using a light source, such as a laser, to illuminate the surface of an object. The light is reflected back from the surface and is then passed through a diffraction grating, which separates the reflected light into different colors. The intensity of the different colors is then measured by a detector, which is used to calculate the profile of the object's surface.
