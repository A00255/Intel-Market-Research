Rigid Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) is a durable, high-strength thermoplastic widely used across various industries due to its resistance to chemicals, impact, and environmental factors. Unlike flexible PVC, rigid PVC is non-plasticized, making it ideal for structural applications such as piping, construction materials, and automotive components. It offers excellent mechanical properties, weather resistance, and cost-effectiveness, driving its adoption in key markets.
