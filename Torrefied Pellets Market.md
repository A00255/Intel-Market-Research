Torrefied pellets are a type of biomass fuel that undergoes a torrefaction process—heating biomass materials such as wood, agricultural residues, and municipal solid waste in a low-oxygen environment. This process removes moisture and volatile compounds, resulting in a high-energy-density product with superior grindability and combustion properties. Torrefied pellets serve as a viable substitute for coal and wood pellets in power generation, heating, and industrial applications.
