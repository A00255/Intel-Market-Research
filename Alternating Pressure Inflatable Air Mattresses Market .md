Alternating Pressure Inflatable Air Mattresses are specialized medical support surfaces designed to relieve and redistribute pressure on the body through a dynamically inflating and deflating system of air cells. These mattresses play a crucial role in the prevention and treatment of pressure ulcers (bedsores), especially for patients who are bedridden or have limited mobility. Constructed with rows of lateral air cells that alternate pressure at set intervals, these mattresses reduce the need for manual repositioning by caregivers and ensure consistent pressure relief across the body. They are commonly used in clinical settings such as hospitals, long-term care facilities, and increasingly in home care environments for patients recovering from surgery or living with chronic immobility.
