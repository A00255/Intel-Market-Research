Bronchial stents are medical devices inserted into the bronchial tubes to keep them open and maintain airflow to the lungs. These stents are primarily used to treat airway obstructions caused by tumors, chronic inflammation, or structural abnormalities. Typically made from metal, silicone, or hybrid materials, bronchial stents are designed to provide immediate relief from symptoms like shortness of breath, wheezing, and coughing.

The primary aim of these stents is to manage conditions such as tracheobronchial stenosis, bronchomalacia, and strictures due to diseases like chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and asthma. With increasing advancements in minimally invasive technologies, bronchial stenting has become an integral component in the treatment of both malignant and benign airway diseases.
