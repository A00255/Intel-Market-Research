Bipolar Electrodialysis (BPED) is an advanced membrane-based separation technology used to produce acids and bases from their respective salts through the application of an electric field. This process is widely utilized in industries such as chemical production, wastewater treatment, food processing, pharmaceutical manufacturing, and lithium extraction. BPED systems provide an energy-efficient, sustainable, and cost-effective alternative to traditional chemical separation processes, making them crucial for circular economy applications.
