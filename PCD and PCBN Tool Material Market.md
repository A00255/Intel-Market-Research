The global PCD and PCBN tool material market was valued at US$ 301.65 million in 2024 and is projected to reach US$ 434.28 million by 2031, growing at a CAGR of 5.59% from 2025 to 2031.

Polycrystalline Diamond (PCD) and Polycrystalline Cubic Boron Nitride (PCBN) tool materials are synthetic cutting materials widely used in precision machining. These materials are engineered to enhance the durability, wear resistance, and cutting efficiency of industrial tools. PCD is preferred for non-ferrous and composite materials, while PCBN is suited for ferrous materials due to its extreme hardness and heat resistance.
