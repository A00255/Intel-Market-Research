Photosensitive Polyimide (PSPI) is a specialized class of polyimide that exhibits photosensitivity, allowing it to be patterned using photolithography techniques. It is widely utilized in the electronics and semiconductor industries for applications such as display panels, chip packaging, and printed circuit boards. PSPI is categorized into two primary types: positive photosensitive polyimide and negative photosensitive polyimide, each offering unique advantages depending on the application requirements.
