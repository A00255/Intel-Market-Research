Freeze Dried Vegetables refer to vegetables that undergo a specific preservation process known as freeze-drying. In this method, vegetables are first frozen and then placed in a vacuum chamber where the moisture content is extracted through sublimation — transforming water from a solid (ice) directly into vapor without passing through a liquid phase. This process helps retain the color, texture, flavor, and nutritional value of the vegetables, offering an extended shelf life without the need for refrigeration.

Freeze-dried vegetables are lightweight, easy to rehydrate, and convenient for various applications including emergency food supplies, outdoor activities like hiking and camping, and as ingredients in instant foods and ready-to-eat meals. Common examples include freeze-dried peas, carrots, bell peppers, sweet corn, and green beans.
