High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) is a type of dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) that offers high-speed data transfer between a processor and the memory. HBM is designed to overcome the limitations of traditional memory architectures, such as DDR4 and GDDR5, by providing a wider data bus and significantly higher bandwidth, which is essential for high-performance computing applications.


•	Stacked architecture: HBM employs a three-dimensional (3D) stack of DRAM dies connected by vertical interconnects, known as through-silicon vias (TSVs), which enables higher density and improved performance.

•	High bandwidth: HBM offers significantly higher bandwidth compared to traditional memory architectures, with data rates up to 1.6 terabytes per second (TB/s) for the latest generation (HBM3).

•	Low power consumption: HBM consumes less power compared to traditional memory types due to its shorter data paths and stacked architecture, making it more energy-efficient.

•	Small form factor: The 3D stacked design of HBM allows for a smaller physical footprint compared to conventional memory architectures, enabling more compact and efficient system designs.
