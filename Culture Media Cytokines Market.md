**Culture Media**: Culture media are liquid or semi-solid solutions designed to support the growth and maintenance of cells in a controlled environment. They provide essential nutrients, growth factors, hormones, and other components required for cell survival, proliferation, and differentiation. Culture media can be broadly classified into the following types:


**Cytokines:** Cytokines are small protein molecules secreted by various cells, particularly those involved in the immune system. They play crucial roles in cell signaling, regulating cellular processes, and coordinating immune responses. Some key functions of cytokines include:


**Hematopoiesis**: Cytokines like erythropoietin and thrombopoietin play crucial roles in the regulation of hematopoietic stem cell differentiation and the production of red blood cells and platelets, respectively
