Electromyography (EMG) equipment refers to medical devices used to evaluate and record the electrical activity produced by skeletal muscles. These devices play a critical role in diagnosing neuromuscular diseases, monitoring nerve function, and guiding treatment plans. EMG equipment can be classified into stationary and portable types, offering flexibility based on clinical and operational needs.

The devices measure electrical signals during muscle contraction and relaxation, providing insights into muscle health and nerve function. They are extensively used in hospitals, diagnostic centers, and home care facilities, making them indispensable in modern healthcare.
