Graphene is a revolutionary material—an allotrope of carbon consisting of a single layer of atoms arranged in a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice. Despite being only one atom thick, it is renowned for its exceptional strength, superior conductivity (both electrical and thermal), and remarkable transparency. Due to these properties, graphene is categorized as a zero-bandgap semiconductor or semi-metal, characterized by a small overlap between the valence and conduction bands.

The Graphene Electronic market encompasses the global industry involved in manufacturing and deploying electronic components and systems based on graphene technology. These include high-frequency transistors, capacitors, sensors, conductive inks, transparent electrodes, and advanced display materials. The market is positioned at the convergence of materials science and electronics, aiming to deliver higher performance, energy efficiency, and miniaturization across multiple sectors, including computing, communication, data storage, green technology, and consumer electronics.
