The Global Inflight Entertainment and Connectivity (IFEC) Market was valued at USD 4,420.74 million in 2024. It is projected to reach USD 8,358.42 million by 2029, reflecting a CAGR of 11.20% during the forecast period (2024-2029). This rapid growth underscores the aviation industry's commitment to enhancing the passenger experience, driven by increasing global air travel and demand for high-quality digital content. Historically, the IFEC market has shown steady growth, moving from basic seat-back screens in the early 2000s to fully interactive and internet-enabled systems by the 2020s. The rise of long-haul and low-cost carriers, combined with growing passenger expectations for always-on connectivity, further fuels this market's expansion.

Inflight Entertainment and Connectivity (IFEC) refers to the suite of onboard services and systems designed to entertain and connect airline passengers during flights. These services encompass video and audio entertainment, gaming, internet access, satellite communication, and real-time data connectivity. Originally limited to overhead movie screens and music channels, IFEC systems have evolved into sophisticated, interactive platforms that allow travelers to stream content, access social media, conduct business tasks, and stay in touch with ground communications while airborne. The integration of Wi-Fi and satellite technology has transformed passenger expectations, making IFEC an essential differentiator in airline competitiveness and customer satisfaction.
