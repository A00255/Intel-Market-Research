The AI on EDGE Semiconductor market refers to the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities directly into edge computing devices via specialized semiconductor chips. Unlike traditional cloud-based AI, which requires data to be processed in centralized data centers, AI on EDGE Semiconductors allows real-time AI processing on the device itself. This technology is essential for applications requiring low latency, enhanced security, and real-time decision-making, such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, smart manufacturing, and IoT devices.
