Mechanical rubber tracks, also referred to as rubber track pads or rubber belting, are robust traction surfaces used on heavy equipment and vehicles. These tracks are manufactured using high-strength rubber compounds designed to deliver optimal traction and support on various terrains, including soft soil, mud, snow, and ice. They are often utilized as a substitute for traditional steel tracks on equipment such as bulldozers, excavators, and military vehicles. Mechanical rubber tracks provide numerous advantages, including reduced ground pressure, enhanced mobility, and quieter operations compared to steel tracks.
