Health Food is a specialty category of food products formulated to deliver additional nutritional or physiological benefits beyond basic sustenance. Unlike conventional foods that primarily address caloric and macronutrient requirements, Health Food often incorporates one or more active ingredients—such as vitamins, minerals, herbs, amino acids, probiotics, or functional extracts—to support specific aspects of human health. Common examples include vitamin-fortified cereals, plant-based protein powders, omegaâ3 fortified spreads, and herbal-infused beverages. By targeting areas like immune support, digestive wellness, cardiovascular health, and cognitive performance, Health Foods have become integral to preventive healthcare and wellness-oriented diets.

Large food companies are quickly evolving to address changing consumer needs. Reformulation is central to the approach companies such as PepsiCo and Nestlé have cut sugar, salt, and artificial ingredients from their products to attract health-conscious consumers. The plant-based products growth isn't slowing, with Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods now fixtures in fast-food restaurants, while traditional meat behemoths such as Tyson Foods heavily invest in alternative proteins. Transparency is also paramount—30% of food brands now use QR codes on pack to deliver immediate access to extensive ingredient sourcing and nutritional information, appealing to consumers who demand transparency. Also gaining mainstream appeal are sustainability promises, with firms like Unilever and Danone committing carbon-neutral production by 2030, echoing increasing demand for climate-resilient food systems.Customers are also asking for cleaner labels, and there was a 25% growth in "free-from" claims (e.g., gluten-free, non-GMO, no artificial preservatives) on new launches (2023 figures). Sustainability is also at the top of the agenda, with 75% of consumers wanting brands that employ green packaging (IBM, 2023), which is forcing businesses to switch to compostable wraps and cut down on plastic usage.
