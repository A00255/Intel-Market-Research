The SMD (Surface-Mount Device) Thermistor market refers to the industry involved in the production and sale of thermistors designed for surface-mount technology (SMT). Thermistors are temperature-sensitive resistors that exhibit a significant change in resistance with a change in temperature. They are widely used in applications such as consumer electronics, medical equipment, automotive, industrial automation, and aerospace. Due to their small size, high accuracy, and cost efficiency, SMD thermistors have become an essential component in temperature sensing and circuit protection.
