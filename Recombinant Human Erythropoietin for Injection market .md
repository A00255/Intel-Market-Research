Recombinant Human Erythropoietin for Injection refers to a biotechnologically engineered form of the naturally occurring erythropoietin hormone, which stimulates red blood cell production. Primarily used in the treatment of anemia especially in patients with chronic kidney disease, cancer-related anemia, and those undergoing dialysis or chemotherapy this injectable therapy mimics the function of endogenous erythropoietin. Erythropoietin is typically produced in the kidneys, and its synthetic counterpart offers a life-saving treatment for patients with deficient erythropoietin levels.

The Recombinant Human Erythropoietin (rEPO) for Injection market is a vital part of the global biopharmaceutical market, driven by its necessary function in treating anemia linked to chronic kidney disease, cancer, and HIV/AIDS. rEPO is a man-made version of a naturally occurring hormone that promotes the production of red blood cells, commonly used to treat anemia due to low erythropoietin levels or dysfunctional bone marrow. The market has been experiencing consistent growth year after year driven by growing incidences of chronic conditions, rising geriatric populations, and wider access to dialysis and chemotherapy procedures. Advances in biologics production technology and wider availability of biosimilar erythropoietins are also driving the market expansion, particularly in the emerging nations. As healthcare systems place emphasis on low-cost and effective treatment for anemia, the rEPO market keeps developing with the help of robust demand in both developed and developing regions.Increasing cancer incidence is a key growth driver for the market. For example, based on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2020 data, 1,603,844 new cancer cases were reported with 602,347 people succumbing to this disease, in U.S

Recent Developments 
=
Biocon Biologics finalized the acquisition of Viatris' worldwide biosimilars business, including rHuEPO products, in 31 countries across Europe. This strategic acquisition, completed in late 2023, increased Biocon's presence in the biosimilars market and will be expected to increase patient access to cost-effective therapies in Europe.

In October 2023, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. and Zydus Lifesciences Ltd. have collaborated to co-promote Desidustat, an oral treatment for anemia specifically developed for Indian patients with chronic kidney disease. The strategic partnership aims to divert the market away from conventional injectable drugs
