Parboiled rice, also known as converted rice, is rice that has been partially boiled in the husk. This process involves soaking, steaming, and drying the rice before milling it. The parboiling process alters the texture of the rice, drives nutrients from the bran into the grain, and makes it easier to process by hand. This results in rice that is firmer, less sticky, and more nutrient-rich than traditionally milled white rice. Parboiled rice is widely used in both developed and developing nations for its extended shelf life, nutritional benefits, and quick cooking time, making it a staple ingredient in the food and beverage industry.
