Nasal decolonization refers to the medical practice of eliminating or significantly reducing the microbial flora—particularly pathogenic bacteria like Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus)—from the nasal cavity. This practice is widely used as part of infection prevention protocols in hospitals and other healthcare settings. The nasal vestibule, the entry area of the nose, is a common colonization site for S. aureus, including Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Colonization can lead to infections if bacteria are transmitted to other parts of the body or to other individuals, typically via hand-to-nose contact.

Decolonization agents typically include topical antibiotics such as mupirocin and antiseptics like povidone-iodine. Mupirocin (branded as Bactroban, Centany, etc.) is frequently used due to its proven efficacy. However, concerns regarding antimicrobial resistance have prompted the exploration and usage of alternative antiseptics. Nasal decolonization is increasingly becoming part of comprehensive infection prevention bundles, especially in surgical environments and intensive care units (ICUs), where patients are at higher risk of acquiring infections.

The market has seen steady historical growth owing to increased surgical procedures worldwide and the growing need for infection control measures. The COVID-19 pandemic has further emphasized the importance of sterilization and hygiene, accelerating adoption across healthcare facilities. Additionally, regulatory bodies and public health organizations are endorsing nasal decolonization strategies as part of broader antimicrobial stewardship programs.
