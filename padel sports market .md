What is the Padel Sports Market?

Padel sports refer to a fast-growing racquet sport that combines elements of tennis, squash, and badminton. Unlike the similarly named paddle tennis in the United States and Canada, padel is distinct and usually played in doubles on an enclosed court about 25% smaller than a standard tennis court. It utilizes a depressurized ball similar to a tennis ball and solid, string-less racquets. The sport is characterized by fast-paced rallies, use of glass walls in gameplay, and a unique blend of strategy and agility. Padel has become immensely popular in Europe and Latin America, and it's witnessing increasing adoption in North America and Asia-Pacific.

The padel sports market encompasses the sales of padel racquets, balls, apparel, shoes, and other associated accessories. It also includes revenues generated through online and offline retail, training academies, tournaments, club memberships, and court installations. The market has attracted attention from global sporting goods companies as well as private equity and investors due to its rapid expansion and mass appeal. According to the World Padel Report, there are over 19,800 clubs and accommodation facilities in the world where to practice padel, of which 5,820 clubs are members of national federations. To compare with 2022, during which there were 3,923 affiliated clubs, FIP increased by 48 percent. There are 130 countries and 12 dependent territories where to play padel, in 2021 there were approximately 90. Europe is the continent with the largest number of clubs and accommodation facilities (64%), followed by South America with 24%, Asia 6%, Africa 4%, Central and North America 2% and Oceania (0.1%).
