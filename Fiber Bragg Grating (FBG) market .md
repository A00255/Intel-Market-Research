Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) is a sophisticated optical filtering technology embedded within the core of optical fibers. Essentially, an FBG is a distributed Bragg reflector that selectively reflects particular wavelengths of light while allowing others to pass. This is achieved by inducing a periodic variation in the refractive index of the fiber core, a process that creates a wavelength-specific dielectric mirror. When light traveling through the fiber encounters the FBG, wavelengths that satisfy the Bragg condition are reflected, while the rest are transmitted. The Bragg condition states that maximum reflection occurs when the grating period is half the wavelength of the incident light. One of the most powerful aspects of FBGs is their sensitivity to strain and temperature. Any changes in these physical parameters cause a shift in the Bragg wavelength, making FBGs ideal for use as highly sensitive sensors in diverse applications such as aerospace, civil engineering, and telecommunications.

U.S. Broadband Expansion (June 2023): The U.S. federal government invested $42.5 billion via the NTIA's Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program to increase broadband connectivity nationwide.India's Optical Fibre Grid (July 2023): India published plans for a $13 billion investment in a national optical fibre grid, to enhance connectivity and make internet affordable.

February 2023: Luna Innovations purchased OptaSense Holdings Ltd. from QinetiQ Group, strengthening its portfolio of fiber optic sensing, particularly in distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) and FBG sensor technologies.
