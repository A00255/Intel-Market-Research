Anthracite mining involves the extraction and processing of anthracite coal, a hard, compact variety of coal with a high carbon content ranging from 85% to 90% and low moisture content (5-15%). It is known for its high heating value, between 13,000 to 15,000 BTUs per pound, making it an essential energy source for various industrial and commercial applications. Due to its superior quality and cleaner-burning properties compared to other coal types, anthracite remains a preferred choice in several industries.
