Sacral neuromodulation (SNM), also referred to as sacral nerve stimulation, is a medical technology involving implantable devices that deliver mild electrical pulses to the sacral nerves—nerves located near the base of the spine responsible for bladder, bowel, and pelvic floor function. The sacral neuromodulation system typically comprises an implantable pulse generator (IPG), a lead (electrode), and an external programmer. These systems are predominantly used to treat conditions such as overactive bladder (OAB), urinary retention, fecal incontinence, and other pelvic floor dysfunctions resistant to conservative treatments.

SNM works by modulating neural pathways, correcting the miscommunication between the brain and the bladder or bowel, thereby restoring normal function. Unlike pharmacologic treatments that merely mask symptoms, sacral neuromodulation targets the underlying neural control mechanisms, offering long-term relief. The devices can be rechargeable or non-rechargeable, and the latest models support features like full-body MRI compatibility, advanced programmability, and battery life exceeding 15 years.

This minimally invasive and reversible procedure has gained wide acceptance as a second-line therapy, following failed behavioral and pharmacological interventions. Its benefits include reduced urinary and fecal episodes, improved quality of life, and decreased reliance on medications, which can often produce undesirable side effects. In recent years, SNM has also been explored for treating chronic pelvic pain and sexual dysfunction, indicating expanding applications for the technology.

Market Size
-
In the United States—the largest market for SNM—the industry was valued at US$ 365.4 million in 2024 and is projected to reach US$ 587.2 million by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 8.2%. This is primarily driven by high healthcare expenditure, advanced clinical infrastructure, and early adoption of medical innovations. It is estimated by the National Association for Continence (NAFC) that 25 million adults in the U.S. suffer from temporary or chronic urinary incontinence. More than 33 million Americans experience OAB symptoms, and almost 50% of women over age 65 experience urinary incontinence.

Key highlights influencing market size:
=
•	In 2023, an estimated 55,000 SNM procedures were performed globally, with North America accounting for 55%.

•	Urinary incontinence is the leading application, constituting 65% of all implantations.

•	Rechargeable devices are witnessing 15% annual growth, owing to longer lifespan and fewer surgical interventions.

•	Reimbursement expansion led to an 18% increase in overall procedures in 2023.

These figures indicate a rapidly evolving market characterized by innovation and broadening indications, promising sustained double-digit growth across both developed and emerging economies.
