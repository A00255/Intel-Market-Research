 
Indium Tin Oxide (ITO) is a composite material made from a combination of indium oxide (InâOâ) and tin oxide (SnOâ). Typically, it consists of about 90% indium oxide and 10% tin oxide by weight. ITO is a transparent conductive oxide (TCO), widely used due to its exceptional electrical conductivity and optical transparency. When in thin-film form, it remains colorless and transparent, whereas in bulk form, it takes on a yellowish-gray hue. ITO is an essential material in industries such as display technology, photovoltaics, and smart windows.
