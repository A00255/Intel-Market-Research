Electronic Personal Dosimetry (EPD) refers to wearable radiation monitoring devices that measure an individual's exposure to ionizing radiation in real-time. These devices are crucial in environments where radiation exposure is a concern, including nuclear power plants, medical facilities, defense sectors, and research laboratories. Electronic personal dosimeters provide immediate dose rate readings, alarm functions, and data logging capabilities, making them superior to traditional passive dosimeters.
