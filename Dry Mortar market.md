Dry mortar refers to pre-mixed construction materials consisting of cement, sand, mineral binders, and other additives. These materials are combined in specific proportions at manufacturing facilities to create a ready-to-use mixture. Dry mortars are used for various applications, such as masonry, plastering, flooring, and tiling, eliminating the need for on-site mixing. Their ease of use, consistent quality, and reduced construction time make them a popular choice in the construction industry.
