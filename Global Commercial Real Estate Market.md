Commercial Real Estate, commonly referred to as CRE, encompasses properties that are used exclusively for business-related purposes or to provide a workspace rather than a living space. These properties include office buildings, retail centers, hotels, warehouses, and industrial buildings. The key differentiator between commercial and residential real estate lies in their intended usage, with CRE being focused on income-generating activities. CRE is a crucial segment of the global economy, offering investment opportunities, supporting employment, and playing a pivotal role in urban development and infrastructure expansion.

Commercial real estate is typically leased to tenants to conduct income-generating activities. The lease agreements vary from short-term contracts to long-term occupancy arrangements. Additionally, these assets are often purchased as part of investment portfolios by individuals, corporations, or real estate investment trusts (REITs) for capital appreciation and rental income. The market is influenced by factors like interest rates, GDP growth, urbanization, foreign investments, and regional policies.

The post-pandemic recovery phase has further accelerated the need for modern commercial infrastructure. Notable developments include hybrid work models driving demand for flexible office spaces, and booming e-commerce creating robust requirements for logistics and warehouse facilities. Additionally, the healthcare and hospitality sectors are experiencing significant real estate investments due to rising population and tourism trends.
