High Pressure Washer refers to a powerful mechanical sprayer designed to remove contaminants such as loose paint, grime, mold, dust, mud, and dirt from various surfaces. Commonly applied on buildings, vehicles, and concrete structures, these washers leverage high-pressure water jets to achieve thorough cleaning. The operational efficiency of these washers is determined by two critical parameters: volume and pressure. Volume, generally expressed in gallons or liters per minute, is typically fixed by the pump design. Pressure, measured in PSI (pounds per square inch), pascals, or bar, can be regulated via the unloader valve. These machines are available in two major types: hot water and cold water washers, each suited for different cleaning needs. Their usage spans household, commercial, and industrial applications, driven by increasing awareness around cleanliness and maintenance.
