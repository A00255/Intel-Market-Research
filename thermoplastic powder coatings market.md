Thermoplastic powder coatings are an advanced and eco-friendly method of applying a protective and decorative finish to various substrates, including metal and plastic. Unlike traditional liquid coatings, these coatings use a dry powder that melts upon heating to form a durable, uniform finish. These coatings do not require solvents, making them an environmentally friendly alternative with minimal volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions. The key components include resins, curing agents, pigments, and performance-enhancing additives.
