Black pellets are a type of advanced biomass fuel made from compressed organic materials, such as wood or agricultural residues. Unlike conventional white wood pellets, black pellets undergo an additional process of torrefaction or steam explosion, which removes moisture and volatile compounds. This process significantly enhances their energy density, durability, and hydrophobic properties, making them a superior renewable energy alternative to coal.

Black pellets are primarily used in power generation as a cleaner substitute for coal, contributing to decarbonization efforts worldwide. Their ability to be co-fired with coal or used in dedicated biomass power plants makes them a key component in the transition towards sustainable energy solutions.
