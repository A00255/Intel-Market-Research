Zirconia-based dental materials are high-performance ceramics composed primarily of zirconium oxide, often combined with other ceramic components. These materials are extensively used in dental applications such as crowns, bridges, inlays, onlays, dentures, and dental implants. Renowned for their exceptional strength, durability, and biocompatibility, zirconia-based dental materials are a preferred choice in modern dentistry. They offer superior resistance to wear, fractures, and corrosion, making them highly suitable for long-lasting dental restorations and implants.
