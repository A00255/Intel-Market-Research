Hydrophilic coatings for medical devices refer to specialized surface treatments designed to enhance the wettability and lubricity of medical instruments. These coatings significantly reduce friction, allowing for smoother insertion and movement of devices such as catheters, guidewires, and stents within the human body. Hydrophilic coatings are widely used in minimally invasive procedures, improving patient comfort and reducing procedural complications.
