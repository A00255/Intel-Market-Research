Truck-mounted concrete pumps are heavy-duty machines equipped with a pump that delivers liquid concrete to construction sites through a mounted boom. These pumps enhance construction efficiency by enabling faster and more precise concrete placement, reducing labor and time costs. They are widely used in high-rise buildings, large-scale infrastructure projects, and commercial construction.
