A filter press machine is an industrial device utilized for solid-liquid separation processes. It operates by using a series of filter plates and cloths, coupled with hydraulic or mechanical pressure, to remove solids from liquid suspensions or slurries. The liquid is forced through the filter cloths, capturing the solid particles, while the filtered liquid, or filtrate, is collected for further use or disposal. These machines are widely employed across industries such as wastewater treatment, chemicals, mining, metallurgy, food, and beverage production.
