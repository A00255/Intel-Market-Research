Styrene Maleic Anhydride (SMA) is a synthetic polymer formed through the radical polymerization of styrene and maleic anhydride monomers, typically using an organic peroxide as the initiator. This copolymer exhibits excellent thermal stability, compatibility with other polymers, and strong adhesion properties, making it highly valuable in industries such as automotive, healthcare, construction, and adhesives. SMA is used in various applications, including automobile instrumentation, compatibilizers, and building materials.
