A local scrubber is an advanced air pollution control device designed to remove contaminants from exhaust gases or air streams within a localized area. These systems are typically deployed in industrial plants or manufacturing facilities to address specific emissions or pollutants at the source. Unlike central scrubbers that manage emissions from an entire facility, local scrubbers focus on specific zones or equipment. They are versatile tools used to eliminate a variety of contaminants, such as particulate matter, sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs).
