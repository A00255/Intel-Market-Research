A Burn-In Test System is a specialized device designed to evaluate the reliability and performance of semiconductor components, such as integrated circuits (ICs), power transistors, sensors, and optoelectronic devices. These systems subject the semiconductor devices to extreme environmental conditions, including elevated temperatures and voltages, to accelerate potential failure mechanisms and identify defects. By exposing components to these stress conditions, manufacturers ensure that only reliable devices are shipped to customers, thus minimizing early-life failures in real-world applications.

Burn-in testing is critical in industries like automotive, aerospace, telecommunications, and consumer electronics, where reliability and performance are paramount.
