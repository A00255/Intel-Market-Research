N-Methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) is an organic compound with the molecular formula CH3N(C2H4OH)2. It is a colorless, hygroscopic liquid with a mild ammonia-like odor. The compound is highly soluble in water, alcohol, and benzene. MDEA is primarily used in amine gas treating, a process also known as gas sweetening or acid gas removal. This involves the removal of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and carbon dioxide (CO2) from natural gas and other industrial gas streams.

Due to its high efficiency in selectively removing H2S while minimizing CO2 removal, MDEA is preferred over conventional amines such as monoethanolamine (MEA) and diethanolamine (DEA). Additional applications of MDEA include its use in the textile, medical, and coatings industries.
